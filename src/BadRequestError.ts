/**
 * BadRequestError errors are used to explicitly declare that your logic has successfully rejected a request
 *
 * Named after HTTPStatusCode_400
 * - > The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent caller error
 * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400
 *
 * Commonly used to return an error to the caller while marking the execution as successful
 * - e.g., the [simple-lambda-handlers](https://github.com/ehmpathy/simple-lambda-handlers) library returns an error to the caller (to notify them of the rejection) while marking the lambda invocation as successful (to avoid cloudwatch metric errors and automated retries)
